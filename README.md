# Finance-Calculator
# Explanation
The finance calculator is a simple calculator used to calculate the amount of interest you will earn on interest.
The finance calculator can also be used to calculate the amount you will have to pay on a home loan which is the bond option.

# Investment option
If you would like to know about the investment option it will ask you details such as:
*The price you will be depositing,
*The interest rate you prefer on paying,
The number of years you would like to pay for, and 
If you would choose 'simple' or 'compound' interest.
That will then print out the amount calculated.

#Bond 
The bond option which will give you the amount to be paid if you take a home loan asks you for:
The current value of the house,
It will ask for the interest rate,
It will ask in how many months you would like to finish to pay the bond,
And that will show you your calculations.
